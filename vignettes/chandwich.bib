 abstract = {A method is developed for utilizing historical control information in testing for a trend in proportions. The resulting test statistic is a modification of the statistic proposed by Cochran (1954, Biometrics 10, 417-451) and by Armitage (1955, Biometrics 11, 375-386). The contribution of the historical data in the analysis depends upon the degree of heterogeneity of the historical rates.},
